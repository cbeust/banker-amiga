	Whenever MUI prints strings, they may contain some special
	character sequences defining format, color and style of the text.

	'\n'	 Start a new line. With this character you can e.g. create
		 multi line buttons.

	ESC -    Disable text engine, following chars will be printed
	         without further parsing.

	ESC u    Set the soft style to underline.

	ESC b    Set the soft style to bold.

	ESC i    Set the soft style to italic.

	ESC n    Set the soft style back to normal.

	ESC <n>  Use pen number n (0..9) as front pen. n must be a valid
		 DrawInfo pen as specified in "intuition/screens.h".

	ESC c    Center current (and following) line(s).
		 This sequence is only valid at the beginning of a
		 string or after a newline character.

	ESC r    Right justify current (and following) line(s).
		 This sequence is only valid at the beginning of a
		 string or after a newline character.

	ESC l    Left justify current (and following) line(s).
		 This sequence is only valid at the beginning of a
		 string or after a newline character.

	ESC I[s] Draw MUI image with specification <s>.

	Note:	 These rules apply to all MUI strings, not only to
		 a text objects contents. You can e.g. format the
	         columns of a listview or include images in a cycle
	         gadgets entries.

    EXAMPLE
	...
	MUIA_Text_Contents, "\33c\33bMUI\33n\nis magic"
	...

	would look like     |    MUI   |  <-- bold
	                    | is magic |  <-- normal
