Banker is a program designed to help you keep an accurate track of your bank accounts.


Banker's main features include :

  .  Entries can be entered as you choose it.  'Amount' and 'Dates' are
     the only fields that are obligatory.  You are free to enter the
     other ones if you wish

  .  Handler "automatic" entries (i.e. entries that occur regularly)

  .  Three output formats are available :  Display Format, Print Format
     and Export  Format (*note Output Formats::.).  You might want to
     display on your screen only a limited number of information, but
     may want to print the database fully (on a 132 columns printer for
     example) and be able to save your file under another form
     understandable by another program...

  .  Full 2.0 graphic user interface.  I put a strong effort in this
     because I feel deeply that a pleasant graphic interface makes the
     difference between a program you use daily and one that is very
     powerful but that you dare not even launch... gadtools is
     brilliant, not perfect but hey! it's all we've got, so let's stick
     to it!  Banker is fully localized too (i.e.  can speak several
     languages, *note Installing Banker::.).

  .  Maximum use of the 2.0 OS features : IffParse(), ReadArgs(),
     amigaguide.library, etc...

  .  User-definable autosave. No more data wasted because of an
     unexpected power loss : Banker will save your file automatically.

  .  A lot more...
